## **Overview**
This is a **React Native service marketplace app** created as a portfolio project to showcase my skills in **frontend development** using **React Native**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Redux**. The app features two roles:
1. **Service Providers**: Create and manage services.
2. **Clients**: Browse, book services, and track progress.

This app focuses on clean design, responsive layouts, and efficient state management.

## **Features**
- **Two User Roles**:
  - Service Providers: Add and edit service listings.
  - Clients: Browse services and book them.
- **State Management**: Built using **Redux** for efficient data handling.
- **Styling**: Fully styled with **TailwindCSS** for fast and responsive UI.
- **Local Data**: Uses mock data to simulate functionality.

## **Technology Stack**
- **React Native**: For cross-platform app development.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **Redux**: For managing app-wide state.

## **About**
This project is not intended for production use but serves as an example of my ability to build dynamic, responsive apps with React Native. Feedback is welcome!
